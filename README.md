# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This is a **Business Sales Analysis Dashboard** built in Power BI using the **Classic Models dataset**.  
It analyzes sales performance, profits, product categories, yearly trends, and country-wise revenue distribution.

## 🔄 Data Transformation (Power Query)
Before creating visuals, I applied several transformations:
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates & handling missing values
- Standardized column data types (currency, dates, text)
- Merged datasets (Orders, Customers, Payments, Products)
- Added calculated columns (Profit, Total Sales)
- Aggregated data for Yearly Sales & Product Line analysis

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
- Total Sales: $1.77M
- Identified top-performing product categories
- Profit distribution by product line & country
- Year-over-year growth analysis
- Interactive KPI cards, bar, pie, and donut charts

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (ETL)
- Classic Models dataset
